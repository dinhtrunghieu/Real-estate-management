Hello, welcome to my project
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use and use the functions in this program

This program consists of 2 parts, building management and customer management, the functions of these two parts are the same, only different images are uploaded.

CRUD:
+ Create: Create a new building/customer, including detailed information about that object
+ Read: Read data from an object, you will read the data of that object when clicking the button of the update function
+ Update: If you have any changes to the data, you can use this function
+ Delete: You can delete one or more objects at once

Pagination:
+ This is the pagination function

Upload image (only for building management):
+ You can create a new building with an accompanying photo or update the photo of a building

Assign
+ This function helps management to assign a building to employees. After that employee is assigned, they can manipulate that object. An object can be managed by multiple employees and vice versa.

Here are some of my explanations of the show, thank you for watching <3
